Introduction:

Numerous corporation have huge interests in investing in external repositories and need to look after them. Accordingly, a solution is required that coordinates repositories with Office database so that corporation can keep up their current interests in report vaults while using the metadata, work process, and joint effort ability of Office database.
Problem statement:

Under the "reasonable use" exception, the law allows that analysts might distribute partitions of a thing under copyright. Authorization to distribute or cite widely from the material should in any case be acquired from the copyright holder.
Vulnerabilities:

There are vulnerabilities associated with the code pulled from the repositories. This vulnerability when not treated, can be exploited by hackers to hack in to the corporate systems.
Solution:

 The designed system ensures that copyright information is adhered to and the vulnerabilities associated to the code pulled from the external repository is being addressed by the internal organization during the usage. The NIST database is used to find CPE and CVE vulnerability information and uses the scanner to verify for copyright infringement.
